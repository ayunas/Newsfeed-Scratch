                <h2><a href='http://www.arabnews.com/news/450743' target="_blank">A former expat’s reflections on Makkah</a></h2>
                <p>On our way to Makkah from Jeddah, I was surprised at the traffic. What was wrong? Everyone was actually driving within the speed limit and in their lanes. There were no cars on the shoulder. I was here for Umrah from the United States, visiting the Kingdom after seven years.
                “There are cameras everywhere. You get snapped and fined, if you break the law. I have received speeding tickets worth SR 900 in the last two months alone,” said our friend, Qureishi.</p>

                <p>
                    There were occasional speedsters, who didn’t seem to be afraid of the cameras. But I soon found out why. Qureishi pointed out that some drivers had placed a white tape on the license plate number, hiding one or two digits hoping to render their vehicle untraceable. I did not see any major accident that day. But I did notice that a large number of vehicles had signs of a fender-bender; broken taillight or dented bumper. I had never seen so many dents on vehicles in a single day in my life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As we sped toward Makkah, I was amazed to see how Saudi Arabia seemed to have grown. There were no signs of recession, but on the contrary economy seemed to be booming. Things were gone or closed, but only to be replaced by something better or bigger. The Beautiful Creatures Zoo was gone. That was a good thing. I remember doing a story on it for Arab News. I had gone at a time when it was breakfast time for pythons. I still remember with a shudder how live rabbits were fed to the snakes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gone was also the Al-Watani supermarket. This is where we did our grocery. I could still remember Al-Watani General Manager Leslie Lloyd who was perplexed as to why oats were the No. 1 seller in Ramadan when it was a breakfast food and people were fasting. He at the time did not know that oats were used for shourba (soup) which was what Saudis ate after breaking their fast.
                </p>
                <p>
                   The visit to the Grand Mosque in Makkah was a very emotional and nostalgic experience for me. I could not believe my eyes when I entered the vicinity of the mosque. It had grown so much. The Clock Tower stood out in its splendor. There were so many new hotels. A portion of the mosque was closed; there were many cranes and construction work going on. There were so many pilgrims, enthusiastic and vibrant. It felt a bit like Haj. The Grand Mosque needed this expansion because of the increase in Haj and Umrah traffic from within and outside the Kingdom. 
                </p>
                <p>The “saiee” downstairs was closed and was only being performed on the top level. The sight of mechanized carts was a pleasant surprise. My 89-year-old mother was with us. She had performed Haj in 1996 and was here for her first Umrah. We rented the battery-operated cart for SR 100 which my husband drove. There was just one slight mishap. Two women riding their cart crashed into ours, but because the speed is never high no one was hurt. However, I noticed two similar mishaps and they both involved women, perhaps because they aren’t accustomed to driving.</p>
                <p>After Umrah, we stopped to eat. I did not have the heart to eat at Al-Baik. When we lived in Jeddah from 1994 onward, my daughters, aged 6 and 7 at the time, loved Al-Baik. “When we go to Makkah, it is ‘Labbaik’ and when we come back it is ‘Al-Baik,’” they said. Now in their 20s and married, I asked them if they wanted anything from Jeddah? “Only Al-Baik,” they said.</p>
                <p>Jeddah looked so different. We lived on Arbaeen Street for seven years but I couldn’t recognize it. The roundabouts were gone replaced by flyovers. Even Arab News had shifted to a beautiful new building. Jeddah looked all dug out, ugly and inconvenient but that is a necessary evil needed in the expansion and beautification of a city.</p>
                <p>Downtown Jeddah looked every inch the vibrant place that it was. Toys were still selling at SR 15.
                Women working at checkout counters in department and grocery stores were something I had never imagined seeing in the Kingdom in my lifetime. I had read about it, but seeing it in person was an awesome experience. Many women I spoke to were all praise for Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Abdullah and said he understood women’s issues and was a very kind and fair ruler. They were also confident that if women were ever allowed to drive, it would be in his reign.</p>
                <p>Men on the other hand, seemed to be the same. Most of them were tired of Jeddah’s traffic delays and diversions. They complained about their wives watching soaps all day. Some also complained of the strict government rules regarding visas and iqamas. In all fairness, I think it is a good thing to streamline the iqama industry. There have always been too many shady practices going on. People came on one company’s iqama, worked for someone else and even their profession was not registered correctly on paper. If implemented thoroughly, everyone will benefit from it. Right now a handful of corrupt people are able to make a lot of money and oftentimes cheat the people they are dealing with.</p>
                <p>We were there for only a week and left Jeddah with mixed feelings of joy and sadness. Immigration and security officers were actually polite and even smiled. I would love to come back to Jeddah in a few years, once the dust settles on the construction, expansion and deep excavation projects. Who knows, I may have a female cabbie, then.</p>

                <h2><a href='https://www.huffiquran vngtonpost.com/entry/bible-or-quran-verses-quiz_us_56d9faf1e4b0000de404a616' target="_blank">Bible And Quran : More Similar Than You May Think</a></h2>
                <p>Islamophobia has become frighteningly commonplace in the U.S. There’s a lot of hatred, misinformation and misplaced fear being directed at Muslims and the faith that they follow. And it’s coming from all levels of society — from GOP presidential frontrunner Donald Trump, who capitalizes on this fear for votes, to local hate groups who take it upon themselves to vandalize American Muslims’ houses of prayer.</p>

                <p>Prominent Christian leaders and organizations have continually spoken out against Islamophobic rhetoric. Still, negative feelings towards Muslims remain. A 2014 Pew Research Center survey asked people to rate religious groups on a “feeling thermometer” that measured positive and negative attitudes. Muslims received the lowest ratings of all religious groups in the country. White evangelical Christians in particular harbored negative feelings towards Muslims.</p>   

                <p>According to The Brookings Institution, Americans differentiate between “Muslim people” and the “Muslim religion.” They tend to view Islam more unfavorably than they view people who practice this faith. Shibley Telhami, a nonresident senior fellow at the Institution, suggested that “it is probably easier for many Americans — with strong anti-discrimination norms — to express dislike of an abstract idea rather than to appear prejudiced toward people.”</p>

                <p>But how well do people really know Islam’s sacred text, and can they distinguish it from the Bible? Is there, as a 2015 Dutch social experiment suggested, an inherent bias about what’s inside the Quran?</p>

                <p>As siblings in the Abrahamic tradition, the Bible and the Quran actually share many similar stories and characters. In addition, both of the books give humanity an overarching sense of purpose and task men and women with the job of spreading love, justice and mercy throughout the world.</p>

                <p>In light of current prejudices — and in order to draw out some common themes in these religious texts — HuffPost Religion put together this collection of verses from the Bible and the Quran. Can you guess which book they came from? Tell us how you did in the comments below.</p>

                <h2><a href='https://humancyclist.wordpress.com/2019/01/27/a-week-in-the-life-of-a-cyclist/'> A Week in the Life of a Cyclist </a></h2>
            
                <p>Sunday. The cyclist’s week begins when others end. Day of the big ride, solo, club or friends. Minimum 2 hours, preferably more. Up early, earlier than what Sunday’s are designed for, early enough to see late night stragglers returning home bleary eyed and wobbly legged. That’ll be you later.</p>

                <p>The Sunday ride ensues. The usual pattern, the only question your fitness and if it’s you dishing out the pain or on the receiving end. Must not be dropped.</p>

                <p>Home. Quick, quick, the clock is ticking on your twenty minute recovery window. Quick! Or is it 40 minutes? Probably time for a quick look at the Strava data. An hour later you have the decision between a shower and food.</p>

                <p>One look at the protein power recipe for the latest super trend food is enough to send you head first into the fridge, the balance of quality over quantity tipping heavily towards the latter.</p>

                <p>You eat without discrimination. The protein-carb balance is near enough you reckon. There’s carbs in beer. Last night’s dog meat kebab is full of protein, amongst other things.</p>

                <p>Heck, you don’t need to justify yourself. You’ve just ridden further than the majority of car journeys today. A long shower is followed by a quick sit down before you can attend to the rest of day.</p>

                <p>You wake up a couple of hours later, groggy, hungry. The day is almost done, no point moving now is there?</p> 

                <p>Monday. The hangover. Yes you overdid the town sign sprint, not to mention each of the 66 miles prior. You ache. All over. You sigh a lot. So much so you have to check there’s not an orchestra of old men behind you.</p>

                <p>Escalators are your friend. You lie down a lot with your feet raised high. Nap time is every twenty minutes. You need a butler. And new muscles.</p>

                <p>Better stretch. Mostly in the form of yawns. These moves looked much easier on Instagram. The foam roller makes for an excellent foot rest. What? No, you don’t look odd lying on the couch in your thigh compression things. Not odd at all. Oh no.</p>

                <p>Tuesday. Still aching. Nothing else much going on. Peak recovery mode. Attempting stretches you half remember from poorly illustrated diagrams that didn’t quite explain how to stretch your whatdoyoucallit muscle. More harm than good. Time for a recovery shake. You’ve earned it.</p>

                <p>Better clean the bike, it looks like it has been on a safari in a monsoon. You feel weak so indiscriminately wave a wet wipe in the general direction of the frame. Quick, rub that dirt into the carpet before someone notices.
                </p>
                <p>You take a bath. No bubbles. Some sort of weird crystals that promise miraculous muscle recovery and turn the water an unfortunate shade of urine yellow. Nobody can relax in yellow water.</p>

                <p>Back to the fridge for the painkillers. Only beer can numb the dull ache.</p>

                <p>Wednesday. Legs a little better. Time for another ride. A gentle one, you know the one when you ride too far and too fast aka the active recovery ride.</p>

                <p>What? It’s not often you get to get compete for the Club Hill Climb Championship, not until the next hill anyway. This is the race everyone knows about despite never talking about it.</p>

                <p>The victor never celebrates because to do so would show how hard they were trying to win the imaginary yet very real race. And of course they weren’t trying. Oh no. Not a chance they were on the limit. Show offs, you think, I’ll have them on the next climb.</p>

                <p>Thursday. A little sore as you plan the weekend ride. You’re already thinking about jersey and sock combinations. Mentally cataloguing the food cupboard for your preferred carbohydrate and protein blend. Must get some beer in.</p>

                <p>Planning the route it’s difficult to leave out that extra climb which is not too far from that lovely climb, which leads to that little beast. Before you know it a gentle 35 mile spin has become a 90 mile self-made monster sportive with more climbing than a big day in the Alps. Shit, 90 miles you think. Just ten more for the metric century. Why not? Everyone likes a round number.</p>

                <p>Swaintoux
                Recovery ride
                You go for a little ride to shake out the legs for the weekend. 3 hours later you’re home, head in fridge, legs throbbing. Ready.</p>

                <p>Friday. Preparation time. Some half-assed core strength exercises first thing. Still can’t hit 15 sit-ups. Porridge. Your own special mix. 75% honey, 20% blueberry, 5% oats. You can’t understand why people don’t like porridge.</p>

                <p>Take it easy at work. Limit the number of trips to the printer. Email everyone, including the folk sat next to you. Rehydrate. Downing little paper cones of water one after another. Smashing them back as if you’d just walked the Sahara.</p>

                <p>Return home and begin to worry about your lack of Strava activity. Post a non-cycling activity, just to prove you’re still alive and get the mileage up. Intervals cutting the grass.</p>

                <p>Saturday. Enforced rest, laid low by a hangover that suggests your carb loading programme was a success. A raging success. You’re grouchy, the perfect opportunity to attempt the fiddly mechanical repair to your front derailleur.</p>

                <p>Three hours later your all sworn out and the noise from the chain rubbing against the derailleur is worse than when you began. It’ll do. You can get the hammer on it next week.</p>

                <p>You check the weather. Every hour. Rain threatens. You check the club forum for casualties. Sure enough the 12 strong group whittles down quickly. Excuses rolled out. Kids. Family. Injuries. Pah! Nobody mentions the real reason. The weather.</p>

                <p>You’re super keen but of course will pull out at the first sign of drizzle. You’re pretty sure you can feel the early signs of a hamstring twinge, the pain heightened whenever the clouds darken.</p>

                <p>The weather front moves north. You’re clear. Better start pre-preparing the excuses in case you get dropped tomorrow.</p>

                <p>Kit laid out, ready for the morning. It’s only lunch time. Counting down the hours. Being nice around the house and helping with the chores before you mutter something about a short ride tomorrow, just the seven hours.</p>

                <p>No cycle racing on the TV you turn to the internet and begin inadvertently browsing the sales in the cycle shops. Of course you need an extra pair of knee warmers. You just never know how quickly you’ll wear through the other six pairs you have.</p>
